Assume you have the following code:
What will each of the 4 puts statements print?

require 'date'

puts Date.civil                         # => -4712-01-01
puts Date.civil(2016)                   # =>  2016-01-01
puts Date.civil(2016, 5)                # =>  2016-05-01
puts Date.civil(2016, 5, 13)            # =>  2016-05-13

Discussion
The documentation for the Date class can be found in the Standard library API documentation. It's not the easiest documentation to use, but for this particular problem, it's easy to look up the civil method.

You can also use the new method instead of civil. However, if you try to read the documentation for new, you will probably walk away feeling unenlightened. Instead, use the civil method.

The documentation for Date::civil (note that it is a class method) shows that its signature is:

civil([year=-4712[, month=1[, mday=1[, start=Date::ITALY]]]]) → date

This signature uses [] to show that all of the arguments are optional. This is only a documentation convention; the brackets should not be included in your program.

Note that the brackets are nested with this method; items inside the outermost bracket pairs can only be omitted if all of the innermost bracket pairs are omitted as well. Hence, if you omit the month argument, you must omit mday and start, but you must supply year. From this signature, then, we can see that arguments to civil can be supplied in 5 different ways:

Date.civil                             # everything defaults
Date.civil(2016)                       # month, mday, start use defaults
Date.civil(2016, 5)                    # mday, start use defaults
Date.civil(2016, 5, 13)                # start uses default
Date.civil(1751, 5, 13, Date::ENGLAND) # nothing defaults

Starting from the left, year defaults to -4712 (there's a good reason for that default) if it is omitted. Likewise, month defaults to 1 (January), mday (the day of month) defaults to 1, and start defaults to Date::ITALY. We're not going to explain the start parameter right now, but you might need it if you ever need to work with Gregorian dates.
